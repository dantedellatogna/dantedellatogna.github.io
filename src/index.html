        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my little spot on the internet. My name is Dante and I'm a
            Computer Engineering student at the Technological University of Panama. Ever
            since I was a child I've been really passionate about technology and science, so,
            when I graduated highschool in 2017 I decided that it was what I wanted to do
            with my life.
