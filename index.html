        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my little spot on the internet. My name is Dante and I'm a
            Computer Engineering student at the Technological University of Panama. Ever
            since I was a child I've been really passionate about technology and science, so,
            when I graduated highschool in 2017, I decided that it was what I wanted to be part of.
            I have many interests, but most of my research projects have been focused on
            AI and Robotics applications. Part of the reason for this, is that I'm a member
            of the ROBOTSIS (Robotics, Simulations and Intelligent Systems) research group at my university.

                <h3>ASCII rendered Torus (Work in Progress)</h3>
                <p>Small project written in C++ that renders a rotating torus entirely with ASCII characters.
                    This was inspired by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Andy Sloane's implementation.</a>
                    The purpose of this project was to test and improve my C++ and math skills.

                <h3>DeepFake Detector</h3>
                <p>Web application that allow the user to upload a picture so the system would try to guess if it's a DeepFake.
                    My main contribution to this project was the development of the neural network that makes the prediction,
                    taking advantage of the MovilNet V2 pre-trained model.
